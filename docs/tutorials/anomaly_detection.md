# Anomaly Detection with FiftyOne and Anomalib [¬∂](\#Anomaly-Detection-with-FiftyOne-and-Anomalib "Permalink to this headline")

![Anomaly Detection Thumbnail](../_images/anomaly_detection_thumbnail.jpg)

Anomaly detection (AD) is a crucial task in mission-critical applications such as fraud detection, network security, and medical diagnosis. Anomaly detection on _visual_ data like images, videos, and satellite imagery, is a particularly challenging task due to the high dimensionality of the data and the complexity of the underlying patterns. Yet visual anomaly detection is essential for detecting defects in manufacturing, identifying suspicious activity in surveillance footage, and detecting
abnormalities in medical images.

In this walkthrough, you‚Äôll learn how to perform anomaly detection on visual data using [FiftyOne](https://fiftyone.ai/) and [Anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib) from the OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ toolkit. We‚Äôll use the [MVTec AD dataset](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad) for demonstration, which contains images of various objects with anomalies like scratches, dents, and holes.

The notebook covers the following:

- What is visual anomaly detection?

- Loading the MVTec AD dataset in FiftyOne

- Training an anomaly detection model with Anomalib

- Evaluating anomaly detection models in FiftyOne


## Setup [¬∂](\#Setup "Permalink to this headline")

### Install dependencies [¬∂](\#Install-dependencies "Permalink to this headline")

Make sure you are running this in a virtual environment with `python=3.10`.

```python
conda create -n anomalib_env python=3.10; conda activate anomalib_env

```

Anomalib requires Python 3.10, so make sure you have the correct version installed.

After this, install Anomalib and its dependencies. If you‚Äôre running this in a colab notebook, the installation might take a few minutes, but local installation should be faster.

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
!pip install -U torchvision einops FrEIA timm open_clip_torch imgaug lightning kornia openvino git+https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib.git

```

Install Anomalib from source, per the instructions in the [Anomalib README](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation)

If you don‚Äôt have it already installed, install FiftyOne. Make sure your version is `fiftyone>=0.23.8` so we can use the [Hugging Face Hub integration](https://docs.voxel51.com/integrations/huggingface.html#huggingface-hub) to load the MVTec AD dataset:

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
!pip install -U fiftyone

```

Just a few more packages to install, and we‚Äôre ready to go. Now you can see why we recommend using a virtual environment for this project!

- `huggingface_hub` for loading the MVTec AD dataset

- `clip` for computing image embeddings

- `umap-learn` for dimensionality reduction


```python
[ ]:

```

```python
!pip install -U huggingface_hub umap-learn git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git

```

### Load and Visualize the MVTec AD dataset [¬∂](\#Load-and-Visualize-the-MVTec-AD-dataset "Permalink to this headline")

Now let‚Äôs import all of the relevant modules we will need from FiftyOne:

```python
[1]:

```

```python
import fiftyone as fo # base library and app
import fiftyone.brain as fob # ML methods
import fiftyone.zoo as foz # zoo datasets and models
from fiftyone import ViewField as F # helper for defining views
import fiftyone.utils.huggingface as fouh # Hugging Face integration

```

And load the [MVTec AD dataset from the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Voxel51/mvtec-ad):

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
dataset = fouh.load_from_hub("Voxel51/mvtec-ad", persistent=True, overwrite=True)

```

üí° It is also possible to load the MVTec AD data directly from Anomalib:

```python
from anomalib.data import MVTec
datamodule = MVTec()

```

But this way we have all of the metadata and annotations in FiftyOne, which is useful for visualization and evaluation.

Before moving on, let‚Äôs take a look at the dataset in the [FiftyOne App](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/app.html):

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
session = fo.launch_app(dataset)

```

![MVTec AD Dataset](../_images/anomaly_detection_initial_dataset.gif)

The dataset has 5354 images across 12 object categories. Each category has ‚Äúgood‚Äù images and ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù images with defects like scratches, dents, and holes. Each of the anomalous samples also has a mask which localizes the defective regions of the image.

The defect labels differ across categories, which is typical in real-world anomaly detection scenarios. In typical anomaly detection scenarios, you train a different model for each category. Here we‚Äôll go through the process for one category, and you can apply the same steps to other categories.

One more thing to note is that the dataset is split into training and test sets. The training set contains only ‚Äúgood‚Äù images, while the test set contains both ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù images.

Before we train a model, let‚Äôs dig into the dataset a bit more. We can get a feel for the structure and patterns hidden in our data by computing image embeddings and visualizing them in a lower-dimensional space. First, we‚Äôll compute embeddings for all the images in the dataset using the [CLIP model](https://github.com/openai/CLIP):

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
model = foz.load_zoo_model(
    "clip-vit-base32-torch"
)  # load the CLIP model from the zoo

# Compute embeddings for the dataset
dataset.compute_embeddings(
    model=model, embeddings_field="clip_embeddings", batch_size=64
)

# Dimensionality reduction using UMAP on the embeddings
fob.compute_visualization(
    dataset, embeddings="clip_embeddings", method="umap", brain_key="clip_vis"
)

```

Refresh the FiftyOne App, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù tab, and select ‚ÄúEmbeddings‚Äù. Choose ‚Äúall\_clip\_vis‚Äù from the dropdown menu. You‚Äôll see a scatter plot of the image embeddings in a 2D space, where each point corresponds to a sample in the dataset. Using the color-by dropdown, notice how the embeddings cluster based on the object category. This is because CLIP encodes semantic information about the images. Also note that _within_ a category, CLIP embeddings don‚Äôt cluster based on the defect type.

![CLIP Embeddings](../_images/anomaly_detection_clip_embeddings.gif)

If instead we embed our images using a traditional computer vision model like ResNet, we also see some clustering within a category based on the defect type. However, as we established earlier, we will not have access to defect labels during inference. Instead, we‚Äôll use an unsupervised anomaly detection model.

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
model = foz.load_zoo_model(
    "resnet50-imagenet-torch"
)  # load the ResNet50 model from the zoo

# Compute embeddings for the dataset ‚Äî this might take a while on a CPU
dataset.compute_embeddings(model=model, embeddings_field="resnet50_embeddings")

# Dimensionality reduction using UMAP on the embeddings
fob.compute_visualization(
    dataset,
    embeddings="resnet50_embeddings",
    method="umap",
    brain_key="resnet50_vis",
)

```

## Train an Anomaly Detection Model [¬∂](\#Train-an-Anomaly-Detection-Model "Permalink to this headline")

Now that we have a sense of the dataset, we‚Äôre ready to train an anomaly detection model using Anomalib.

**Task**: Anomalib supports classification, detection, and segmentation tasks for images. We‚Äôll focus on segmentation, where the model predicts whether each pixel in the image is anomalous or not, creating a mask that localizes the defect.

**Model**: Anomalib supports a variety of anomaly detection algorithms, including [Deep Feature Kernel Density Estimation (DFKDE)](https://anomalib.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.1/markdown/guides/reference/models/image/dfkde.html), [FastFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07677), and [Reverse Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10703v2). For a complete list of supported algorithms, check out [Anomalib‚Äôs reference\\
guide](https://anomalib.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.1/markdown/guides/reference/models/image/index.html). For this walkthrough, we‚Äôll use two algorithms:

- [PaDiM: a Patch Distribution Modeling Framework for Anomaly Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08785)

- [PatchCore: Towards Total Recall in Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08265)


**Preprocessing**: For this walkthrough, we will resize the images to 256x256 pixels before training the model. Adding this as a transform via Torchvision‚Äôs `Resize` class lets us resize the images on-the-fly during training and inference.

Import the necessary modules from Anomalib and helper modules for processing images and paths:

```python
[15]:

```

```python
import numpy as np
import os
from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
from torchvision.transforms.v2 import Resize

```

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
from anomalib import TaskType
from anomalib.data.image.folder import Folder
from anomalib.deploy import ExportType, OpenVINOInferencer
from anomalib.engine import Engine
from anomalib.models import Padim, Patchcore

```

Now define some constants to use throughout the notebook.

- `OBJECT`: The object category we‚Äôll focus on. For this walkthrough, we‚Äôll use ‚Äúbottle‚Äù. If you want to loop over categories, you can get the list of categories from the dataset with `dataset.distinct("category.label")`.

- `ROOT_DIR`: The root directory where Anomalib will look for images and masks. Our data is already stored on disk, so we will just symlink files to the directory Anomalib expects.

- `TASK`: The task we‚Äôre performing. We‚Äôll use ‚Äúsegmentation‚Äù for this walkthrough.

- `IMAGE_SIZE`: The size to resize images to before training the model. We‚Äôll use 256256 x 256256 pixels.


```python
[17]:

```

```python
OBJECT = "bottle" ## object to train on
ROOT_DIR = Path("/tmp/mvtec_ad") ## root directory to store data for anomalib
TASK = TaskType.SEGMENTATION ## task type for the model
IMAGE_SIZE = (256, 256) ## preprocess image size for uniformity

```

For a given object type (category), the `create_datamodule()` function below creates an Anomalib `DataModule` object. This will get passed into our engine‚Äôs `fit()` method to train the model, and will be used to instantiate dataloaders for training and validation.

The code might look complex, so let‚Äôs break down what‚Äôs going on:

- We create subsets of our data containing only the ‚Äúgood‚Äù training images and ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù images for validation.

- We symlink the images and masks to the directory Anomalib expects.

- We instantiate and setup a datamodule from Anomalib‚Äôs `Folder`, which is the general-purpose class for custom datasets.


üí° It is also possible to create a torch `DataLoader` from scratch and pass it to the engine‚Äôs `fit()` method. This gives you more control over the data loading process. This is left as an exercise for the reader üòâ.

```python
[21]:

```

```python
def create_datamodule(object_type, transform=None):
    ## Build transform
    if transform is None:
        transform = Resize(IMAGE_SIZE, antialias=True)

    normal_data = dataset.match(F("category.label") == object_type).match(
        F("split") == "train"
    )
    abnormal_data = (
        dataset.match(F("category.label") == object_type)
        .match(F("split") == "test")
        .match(F("defect.label") != "good")
    )

    normal_dir = Path(ROOT_DIR) / object_type / "normal"
    abnormal_dir = ROOT_DIR / object_type / "abnormal"
    mask_dir = ROOT_DIR / object_type / "mask"

    # create directories if they do not exist
    os.makedirs(normal_dir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(abnormal_dir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(mask_dir, exist_ok=True)

    if not os.path.exists(str(normal_dir)):
        normal_data.export(
            export_dir=str(normal_dir),
            dataset_type=fo.types.ImageDirectory,
            export_media="symlink",
        )

    for sample in abnormal_data.iter_samples():
        base_filename = sample.filename
        dir_name = os.path.dirname(sample.filepath).split("/")[-1]
        new_filename = f"{dir_name}_{base_filename}"
        if not os.path.exists(str(abnormal_dir / new_filename)):
            os.symlink(sample.filepath, str(abnormal_dir / new_filename))

        if not os.path.exists(str(mask_dir / new_filename)):
            os.symlink(sample.defect_mask.mask_path, str(mask_dir / new_filename))

    datamodule = Folder(
        name=object_type,
        root=ROOT_DIR,
        normal_dir=normal_dir,
        abnormal_dir=abnormal_dir,
        mask_dir=mask_dir,
        task=TASK,
        transform=transform
    )
    datamodule.setup()
    return datamodule

```

Now we can put it all together. The `train_and_export_model()` function below trains an anomaly detection model using Anomalib‚Äôs `Engine` class, exports the model to OpenVINO, and returns the model ‚Äúinferencer‚Äù object. The inferencer object is used to make predictions on new images.

```python
[19]:

```

```python
def train_and_export_model(object_type, model, transform=None):
    engine = Engine(task=TASK)
    datamodule = create_datamodule(object_type, transform=transform)
    engine.fit(model=model, datamodule=datamodule)

    engine.export(
        model=model,
        export_type=ExportType.OPENVINO,
    )
    output_path = Path(engine.trainer.default_root_dir)

    openvino_model_path = output_path / "weights" / "openvino" / "model.bin"
    metadata = output_path / "weights" / "openvino" / "metadata.json"

    inferencer = OpenVINOInferencer(
        path=openvino_model_path,
        metadata=metadata,
        device="CPU",
    )
    return inferencer

```

Let‚Äôs try this with `PaDiM` first. The training process should take less than a minute:

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
model = Padim()

inferencer = train_and_export_model(OBJECT, model)

```

And just like that, we have an anomaly detection model trained on the ‚Äúbottle‚Äù category. Let‚Äôs run our inferencer on a single image and inspect the results:

```python
[23]:

```

```python
## get the test split of the dataset
test_split = dataset.match(F("category.label") == OBJECT).match(
    F("split") == "test"
)

## get the first sample from the test split
test_image = Image.open(test_split.first().filepath)

output = inferencer.predict(image=test_image)
print(output)

```

```

The output contains a scalar anomaly score `pred_score`, a `pred_mask` denoting the predicted anomalous regions, and a heatmap `anomaly_map` showing the anomaly scores for each pixel. This is all valuable information for understanding the model‚Äôs predictions. The `run_inference()` function below will take a FiftyOne sample collection (e.g.¬†our test set) as input, along with the inferencer object, and a key for storing the results in the samples. It will run the model on each sample in
the collection and store the results. The `threshold` argument acts as a cutoff for the anomaly score. If the score is above the threshold, the sample is considered anomalous. In this example, we‚Äôll use a threshold of 0.50.5, but you can experiment with different values.

```python
[24]:

```

```python
def run_inference(sample_collection, inferencer, key, threshold=0.5):
    for sample in sample_collection.iter_samples(autosave=True, progress=True):
        output = inferencer.predict(image=Image.open(sample.filepath))

        conf = output.pred_score
        anomaly = "normal" if conf < threshold else "anomaly"

        sample[f"pred_anomaly_score_{key}"] = conf
        sample[f"pred_anomaly_{key}"] = fo.Classification(label=anomaly)
        sample[f"pred_anomaly_map_{key}"] = fo.Heatmap(map=output.anomaly_map)
        sample[f"pred_defect_mask_{key}"] = fo.Segmentation(mask=output.pred_mask)

```

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
run_inference(test_split, inferencer, "padim")

```

Let‚Äôs visualize these results in the FiftyOne App:

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
session = fo.launch_app(view=test_split)

```

![Anomaly Detection PaDiM Results](../_images/anomaly_detection_padim.gif)

## Evaluate Anomaly Detection Models [¬∂](\#Evaluate-Anomaly-Detection-Models "Permalink to this headline")

We have an anomaly detection model, but how do we know if it‚Äôs any good? For one, we can evaluate the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score. FiftyOne‚Äôs [Evaluation API](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/evaluation.html#) makes this easy. We are going to evaluate the full-image classification performance of the model, as well as the segmentation performance.

We need to prepare our data for evaluation. First, we need to add null masks for the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù images to ensure the evaluation is fair:

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
for sample in test_split.iter_samples(autosave=True, progress=True):
    if sample["defect"].label == "good":
        sample["defect_mask"] = fo.Segmentation(
            mask=np.zeros_like(sample["pred_defect_mask_padim"].mask)
        )

```

We also need to ensure consistency in naming/labels between ground truth and predictions. We‚Äôll rename all of our ‚Äúgood‚Äù images to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and every type of anomaly to ‚Äúanomaly‚Äù:

```python
[39]:

```

```python
old_labels = test_split.distinct("defect.label")
label_map = {label:"anomaly" for label in old_labels if label != "good"}
label_map["good"] = "normal"
mapped_view = test_split.map_labels("defect", label_map)

```

```python
[40]:

```

```python
session.view = mapped_view.view()

![Mapped View](../_images/anomaly_detection_mapped_labels.jpg)

For classification, we‚Äôll use binary evaluation, with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù as the negative class and ‚Äúanomaly‚Äù as the positive class:

```python
[41]:

```

```python
eval_classif_padim = mapped_view.evaluate_classifications(
    "pred_anomaly_padim",
    gt_field="defect",
    eval_key="eval_classif_padim",
    method="binary",
    classes=["normal", "anomaly"],
)

```

```python
[42]:

```

```python
eval_classif_padim.print_report()

```

```python
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

      normal       0.95      0.90      0.92        20
     anomaly       0.97      0.98      0.98        63

    accuracy                           0.96        83
   macro avg       0.96      0.94      0.95        83
weighted avg       0.96      0.96      0.96        83

```

The model performs quite well on the classification task!

If we go back over to the app and sort by anomaly score, we can see that certain types of anomalies tend to have higher scores than others. In this example, `contamination` instances tend to have either very high or very low scores relative to `broken_small` and `broken_large`. When we put this model in production we might be more likely to miss certain types of anomalies. Other types of models, or ensembles of models, might be more robust to this!

For segmentation evaluation, we will only be interested in pixel values of 00 (normal) and 255255 (anomaly), so we will filter our report for these ‚Äúclasses‚Äù:

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
eval_seg_padim = mapped_view.evaluate_segmentations(
    "pred_defect_mask_padim",
    gt_field="defect_mask",
    eval_key="eval_seg_padim",
)

```

```python
[44]:

```

```python
eval_seg_padim.print_report(classes=[0, 255])

```

```python
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.99      0.96      0.98 63343269.0
         255       0.60      0.89      0.72 3886731.0

   micro avg       0.96      0.96      0.96 67230000.0
   macro avg       0.80      0.93      0.85 67230000.0
weighted avg       0.97      0.96      0.96 67230000.0

```

### Compare Anomaly Detection Models [¬∂](\#Compare-Anomaly-Detection-Models "Permalink to this headline")

Just because anomaly detection is unsupervised doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt compare models and choose the best one for our use case. We can train multiple models on the same data and compare their performance using metrics like F1 score, precision, and recall. We can also compare the models visually by inspecting the masks and heatmaps they generate.

Let‚Äôs repeat the training process for the `PatchCore` model and compare the two models:

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
## Train Patchcore model and run inference

model = Patchcore()

## This will take a little longer to train, but should still be < 5 minutes
inferencer = train_and_export_model(OBJECT, model)

run_inference(mapped_view, inferencer, "patchcore")

```

```python
[46]:

```

```python
## Evaluate Patchcore model on classification task
eval_classif_patchcore = mapped_view.evaluate_classifications(
    "pred_anomaly_patchcore",
    gt_field="defect",
    eval_key="eval_classif_patchcore",
    method="binary",
    classes=["normal", "anomaly"],
)

eval_classif_patchcore.print_report()

```

```python
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

      normal       0.95      1.00      0.98        20
     anomaly       1.00      0.98      0.99        63

    accuracy                           0.99        83
   macro avg       0.98      0.99      0.98        83
weighted avg       0.99      0.99      0.99        83

```

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
eval_seg_patchcore = mapped_view.match(
    F("defect.label") == "anomaly"
).evaluate_segmentations(
    "pred_defect_mask_patchcore",
    gt_field="defect_mask",
    eval_key="eval_seg_patchcore",
)

```

```python
[48]:

```

```python
eval_seg_patchcore.print_report(classes=[0, 255])

```

```python
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.99      0.95      0.97 47143269.0
         255       0.60      0.85      0.70 3886731.0

   micro avg       0.95      0.95      0.95 51030000.0
   macro avg       0.80      0.90      0.84 51030000.0
weighted avg       0.96      0.95      0.95 51030000.0

```

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
session.view = mapped_view.shuffle().view()

```

![Compare Models](../_images/anomaly_detection_compare_models.gif)

The metrics back up what we see in the app: PatchCore has much higher recall for the ‚Äúanomaly‚Äù class, but lower precision. This means it‚Äôs more likely to catch anomalies, but also more likely to make false positive predictions. After all, PatchCore is designed for ‚Äútotal recall‚Äù in industrial anomaly detection.

Looking at the heatmaps, we can also see what types of anomalies each model is better at detecting. An ensemble of the two models might be more robust to different types of anomalies.

## Test Data Augmentation Techniques [¬∂](\#Test-Data-Augmentation-Techniques "Permalink to this headline")

Beyond the anomaly detection algorithm itself, there are many other knobs we can turn to improve the performance of our model. These include:

- Backbone: The architecture of the model used for feature extraction

- Algorithm hyperparameters: Parameters specific to the anomaly detection algorithm. For PatchCore, this includes `coreset_sampling_ratio` and `num_neighbors`.

- Data augmentation: Techniques to artificially increase the size of the training set and improve the model‚Äôs generalization.


This section briefly illustrates the role of data augmentation techniques in anomaly detection. We‚Äôll use [FiftyOne‚Äôs Albumentations plugin](https://github.com/jacobmarks/fiftyone-albumentations-plugin) to test and visualize transformations on ‚Äúgood‚Äù samples from the dataset and then apply the same transformations (with `torchvision.transforms`) to the training images.

The goal is to increase the diversity of the training set without changing the images so much that we verge into the ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù territory.

First, let‚Äôs install [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/docs/) and download the plugin:

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
pip install -U albumentations

```

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
!fiftyone plugins download https://github.com/jacobmarks/fiftyone-albumentations-plugin

```

Refresh the FiftyOne App and hit the backtick key on your keyboard to open the operators list. Select `"augment_with_albumentations"` from the dropdown menu. Try applying transformations like `GaussianBlur`, and `ColorJitter`, and see how they affect the images. Use the `"view_last_albumentations_run"` operator to see the augmentations generated by the last run. Play around with the kernel size for blurring, and the brightness, contrast, and saturation values for color jittering.
Depending on the object category, it might also make sense to apply 90 degree rotations, horizontal flips, and other transformations!

![Data Augmentation](../_images/anomaly_detection_augment.gif)

Once you‚Äôre happy with the transformations, use the `"get_last_albumentations_run_info"` operator to see the transformations applied and their parameters. You can then use these with `torchvision.transforms` to augment the training images.

```python
[49]:

```

```python
from torchvision.transforms.v2 import GaussianBlur, ColorJitter, Compose

```

```python
[50]:

```

```python
transform = Compose([\
    Resize(IMAGE_SIZE, antialias=True),\
    GaussianBlur(kernel_size=3),\
    ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2),\
])

```

```python
[ ]:

```

```python
model = Patchcore()
augmented_inferencer = train_and_export_model(
    OBJECT, model, transform=transform
)

run_inference(mapped_view, augmented_inferencer, "patchcore_augmented")

session.view = mapped_view.view()

```

This is just a starting point for data augmentation. You can experiment with different transformations and parameters to see what works best for your dataset.

## Summary [¬∂](\#Summary "Permalink to this headline")

In this walkthrough, we learned how to perform anomaly detection on visual data using FiftyOne and Anomalib. We trained two anomaly detection models, PaDiM and PatchCore, on the MVTec AD dataset and evaluated their performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score. We also visualized the models‚Äô predictions using heatmaps and masks. Finally, we tested data augmentation techniques to improve the models‚Äô generalization.
